# API documentation options

- [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)
  
  - Bad vertical UI/UX

- [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc)
  
  - Paid try-in functionality

- [Rapidoc](https://github.com/rapi-doc/RapiDoc)
  
  - Doesn't feature 3-column design

- **[Stoplight Elements](https://github.com/stoplightio/elements)**
  
  - Doesn't have a lot of configuration options
  - Not so popular
  - Backed by commercial company

If you annotate your API using OpenAPI spec than you can easily generate a whole API docs frontend website from it. The docs are important if your API will be used by other developers and integrated into different system.

My go-to choose will be Elements by Stoplight. It has a lot of features missing from previous options:

- try-in functionality

- 3-column design (stripe-esque)

- React and web components support

- generate sample request code

- paginated endpoints and schemas
